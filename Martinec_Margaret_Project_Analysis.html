<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

<p>In my extensive research of your competitors, I have discovered Trifles and Truffles is quite unique in what your site has to offer.  I will attempt to promote the fact that your site is what they are looking for in a one stop experience for cooking, gift baskets, gourmet food, group classes, and private parties.  For example, if they just want to take a simple cooking class without having to sign up at a culinary school, they should choose Truffles & Trifles because there were no other local cooking classes in my search of your local area.</p>

    <h2>Site Intent</h2>

<p>The intent is to redesign the Truffles & Trifles website to organize the content into six pages which will include the home page, about us, cooking classes, fresh baked goods, gift baskets, and private parties.</p> 

<p>A new navigation system will be implemented so the users will not have to hit their “back” button or have to scroll to the bottom of each page to get to another page. This will aid in your website becoming more user friendly.  The more user friendly it becomes will result in visitors staying on your site longer.</p>

<p>In my evaluation of your website, I have discovered numerous HTML errors.  This will be corrected.  The embedded style sheet will be removed and replaced with attached style sheets.</p>

<p>A prominent call to action to sign up for cooking classes will be placed on each page to encourage visitors to fill in the form.</p> 

<p>I will make a slight modification to update your logo so that it looks more professional.</p>

<p>Each page will have the same style, which will enhance the beauty of your site.  Unnecessary content will either be moved to a different page or eliminated from its current state.</p>

<p>The keywords will be arranged so that each page will get your targeted audience for a specific keyword.  In my research of your competitors, I have found that they use many of the same keywords you already have in place so I suggest we continue to use those words.
